                While we do the best we can from our end to keep your data
                secure, here's some steps you can take to have a safe order
                experience: 1. Never share your credentials and bank account
                details with anyone. riders, and restaurant/ store partners will
                never ask for sensitive information. This includes passwords,
                OTP, credit or debit card PIN, and card details such as card
                number, CVV, and expiry date. 2. Beware of scammers posing as
                personnel or partners to obtain personal information or money
                from you. We'll never ask you to do any financial transactions
                outside the app. To confirm information about your order, please
                check "My Orders" on your app or reach out to Support. 3. Beware
                of unsolicited calls asking you to turn off your device or to
                put your device on aeroplane mode while your order is being
                processed. Doing so might lead to the cancellation of your
                order. we will never request such things from you. 4. Verify if
                the email you received is from an official address. If you
                receive an email containing deals or promotions that seem
                suspicious to you, make sure to check if the sender’s email
                address looks legitimate. Official emails should always have the
                company’s official domain name . 5. Always keep your contact
                details updated on your account and turn on notifications for
                your app to receive important alerts from us. To update your
                details, head over to the "Profile" section on our app or web.
